# ✅ Deployment Fixed!

## What Was Changed

The deployment error has been fixed! Here's what was updated:

### 1. **next.config.ts**
- ❌ Removed `output: 'export'` (static export mode)
- ✅ Now uses standard Next.js build (supports dynamic routes)

### 2. **firebase.json**
- ❌ Removed `"public": "out"` (static folder)
- ✅ Added Next.js framework integration with `"source": "."`
- ✅ Firebase will now auto-build and deploy your Next.js app

### 3. **deploy.sh**
- ❌ Removed manual `npm run build` step
- ✅ Firebase now handles the build automatically

---

## How to Deploy Now

### Easiest Way - Use the Script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Or Deploy Manually:

```bash
# Step 1: Deploy Firebase rules (fixes 403 errors)
firebase deploy --only storage,firestore

# Step 2: Deploy hosting (Firebase auto-builds Next.js)
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Or Deploy Everything:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

---

## What Firebase Will Do

When you run `firebase deploy --only hosting`:

1. ✅ Detects Next.js project
2. ✅ Automatically runs `npm install`
3. ✅ Automatically runs `npm run build`
4. ✅ Deploys the built app
5. ✅ Sets up serverless functions for dynamic routes
6. ✅ Makes your app live!

## Your Live URLs

After deployment:

- **Main App**: https://studio-billzai.us-central1.hosted.app
- **Bill Sharing**: https://studio-billzai.us-central1.hosted.app/bill/[billId]
- **History**: https://studio-billzai.us-central1.hosted.app/history
- **Edit Bills**: https://studio-billzai.us-central1.hosted.app/edit/[billId]
