## Deploy in 3 Simple Steps

### Option 1: Use the Deploy Script (Easiest)

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will automatically:
1. Build your app
2. Deploy Firebase rules
3. Deploy to Firebase Hosting

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

#### Step 1: Build
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage,firestore
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Option 3: Deploy Everything at Once

```bash
npm run build && firebase deploy
```

---

## First Time Setup

If you haven't logged in to Firebase CLI yet:

```bash
firebase login
```

Make sure you're using the correct project:

```bash
firebase use billzai
```

---

## Your Live URLs

After deployment:

- **Main App**: https://studio-billzai.us-central1.hosted.app
- **Shareable Links**: https://studio-billzai.us-central1.hosted.app/bill/[billId]
